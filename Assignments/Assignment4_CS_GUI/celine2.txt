She was a lone wanderer from moscow
Unaware of the path her destiny would someday condone
In 1957
She was liberated from the clutches of the streets
And found herself chosen for a singular mission
She was left in the belief that she finally found a new family
A new home
But she didn't know what her destiny was
Blindrolded
She was sent into that dark night
Never to return
Her tragic destiny became a symbol
A stark reminder of the sacrifice
We are willing to make in order to pioneer the unknown
She never had a voice in the matter
A helpless passenger on an unforgiving voyage
